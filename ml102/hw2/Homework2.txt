HW2

In class, we constructed a clustering problem by generating 
gaussian clusters of 100 points around each of 25 centers - 
centers with coordinates (i,j) i = 1 to 5 and j = 1 to 5.  

See what number of clusters looks like the best clustering 
of this system for for each of three situations 
sd = 0.1, sd = 0.2 and sd = 0.5.  

Use both the inflection point technique and the 
AIC (Akaike information criterion) to make your determination.
