Compare the various clustering techniques:

I was surprised at how well kmeans() did with these data. The data look
very noisy, and I was surprised that it could be clustered at all.

However, the kmeans models were not consistent form one run to the next.
Perhaps it would be better to initialize with canopy? Perhaps other iteration
arguments would help?

Regarding agnes and diana, I have no idea how to interpret the output!
I will need to ask in class on Saturday.
